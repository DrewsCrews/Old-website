<h1> Andrew :)</h1>
<h3> Hello! On this website, you will be learning more about me and my interests.</h3>
<p>First of all, this is me.</p>
<p> No I'm not a blank space, I can explain my features. I have black spiked up hair, bronze brown eyes, I'm tall, and I enjoy reading.</p>
<p> Maybe, just maybe. That is not enough about me. Here is some other info about me. I might not give you so so so so so so personal info, but here is the basic idea. I like reading, as I said before. My favorite book is "where the Mountain meets the Moon". My favorite color is light blue, maybe like some of you.
    BTW I also enjoy playing Pokemon Shuffle, which is a puzzle game in which you have to match 3 or more of the same pokemon in order to damage the pokemon you are facing in each level.</p>
<h3> Here is an example of the game. </h3>

         <img src="http://img03.deviantart.net/2db4/i/2014/226/2/4/_commission____sleeping_chibi_latias_by_pcat007-d7v50b5.png" width= 93%>
             <p> It is sooooooo cute.</p>
         <p> This picture was made on various websites, some known as "Fakemon", which this is not. In fact. This is a chibi version of latias. It was from the website "Deviant Art", if you ever heard of it before. Another art website is "tumblr". You can google these websites, and look through them as you wish.</p>
             <p> Here is another picture</p>
        <img src="http://pre06.deviantart.net/f404/th/pre/i/2015/056/c/7/royal_shiny_charizard___gift___by_itachi_roxas-d8jj7bw.png" width= 95%>
            <p> Apparently, that is a royal charizard. I have lots more and I will show you some throughout the website.</p>

    <p> Now lets get back to me. If you got here and started getting bored, sorry guys. Also if you want to take a break, you can go to one of those other websites I posted up there in the hyperlink, or play games on a website called "Yepi" which I will give you the link to right now. If you want to continue reading down the website, go right on.</p>
    <a href="http://yepi.com"> Click to play games on yepi</a>
    <p> I also would like to tell you many more things about me, if you would like to continue on</p>
    <p> First of all, my favorite symbol is... "The Greek Symbol for Knowledge</p>

    <p>haha not very funny</p>
    <h1> What if I told you... THIS IS NOT THE END???</h1>
    <p> Let me guess, I am boring you to death? Or entertaining you to life?</p>
    <p> Probably the first one.</p>
    <p> But there's more... so check this web every day, and more surprises galore. Be sure to check out the websites I linked up, but in the meantime, keep going down this website. If you are a student in ccms congratulations. You can email me on gmail "andrewfan@students.ccusd.org". Now we shall continue so far soooo......................................................bad.</p>
    <p> Hallo again. This website so far has been very fun creating, and I hope it is very fun looking at. May the adventures last!!!</p>
<p> I'm back, and better than ever... never mind that thing, it was just stuck in my head. oh, have you ever heard of... the illuminati? A triangle, basically for those who don't know, with one eye "I" haha. Here is a picture of a cartoon "imposter" version of the illuminati.</p>
   <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yRj6xdG4I78/VgeiUvqBfuI/AAAAAAAACGE/gU2PO4WHapM/w599-h600/bill.gif"width= 95%</a>
   <p> Imposter...</p>
   <p> Whatever, Bill Cipher is that illuminati's name, and if you are Darren Chew, you will probably know about Gravity Falls.</p>
   <p> Hello Sierra, if you are out there. This is a pretty good website for you, as an artist. Thank me later, or don't actually... don't if you don't want to of course...:(</p>
   <a href="http://www.deviantart.com"> Click this to look into the world of creative artists...DEVIANTART</a>
   
   <p> Hi Kona, you will probably like this gif it is a victini.</p>
  <img src="http://45.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jx7lL7Sx1r3ifxzo1_500.gif" width= 95%</a>
  <p> Well folks, let's continue. This took very long to make, considering it was a very short class. Write now, I'm just writing this all down in my notebook. I hope this is entertaining you.</p>
  <p> More about me... When I go to college, I want to study computer science, or architectural design. I want to become an inventor or architect. I also want to go to UCLA. Or USC. Or Berkeley. Usually I read books, and answer my emails. But before that, I also have to finish my homework and usually play badminton outside.</p>
  <p> If you really wanted to know, I went to El Marino, and I still go there everyday to pick up my siblings.</p>
  <p> It also is really confusing putting up this website and controlling it. But, it is really nice to have all of you looking at it, so thanks. I will try my best to upgrade it everyday!!!</p>
