<h1> Andrew owns this website! :)> <- goatee.</h1>
<h3> Hello! On this website, you will be learning more about me and my interests.</h3>
<p>First of all, this is me.</p>
<p> No I'm not a blank space, I can explain my features. I have black spiked up hair, bronze brown eyes, I'm tall, and I enjoy reading.</p>
<p> Maybe, just maybe. That is not enough about me. Here is some other info about me. I might not give you so so so so so so personal info, but here is the basic idea. I like reading, as I said before. My favorite book is "where the Mountain meets the Moon". My favorite color is light blue, maybe like some of you.
    BTW I also enjoy playing Pokemon Shuffle, which is a puzzle game in which you have to match 3 or more of the same pokemon in order to damage the pokemon you are facing in each level.</p>
<h3> Here is an example of the game. </h3>

         Logophile meaning a lover of words. and. Cognoscenti meaning, someone with superior knowledge of something. Ex. Literature, art, world fashion, etc.</p>

             <p> It is sooooooo cute.</p>
         <p> This picture was made on various websites, some known as "Fakemon", which this is not. In fact. This is a chibi version of latias. It was from the website "Deviant Art", if you ever heard of it before. Another art website is "tumblr". You can google these websites, and look through them as you wish.</p>
             <p> Here is another picture</p>
        <img src="http://pre06.deviantart.net/f404/th/pre/i/2015/056/c/7/royal_shiny_charizard___gift___by_itachi_roxas-d8jj7bw.png" width= 95%>
            <p> Apparently, that is a royal charizard. I have lots more and I will show you some throughout the website.</p>

    <p> Now lets get back to me. If you got here and started getting bored, sorry guys. Also if you want to take a break, you can go to one of those other websites I posted up there in the hyperlink, or play games on a website called "Yepi" which I will give you the link to right now. If you want to continue reading down the website, go right on.</p>
    <a href="http://yepi.com"> Click to play games on yepi</a>
    <p> I also would like to tell you many more things about me, if you would like to continue on</p>
    <p> First of all, my favorite symbol is... "The Greek Symbol for Knowledge</p>

    <p>haha not very funny</p>
    <h1> What if I told you... THIS IS NOT THE END???</h1>
    <p> Let me guess, I am boring you to death? Or entertaining you to life?</p>
    <p> Probably the first one.</p>
    <p> But there's more... so check this web every day, and more surprises galore. Be sure to check out the websites I linked up, but in the meantime, keep going down this website. If you are a student in ccms congratulations. You can email me on gmail "andrewfan@students.ccusd.org". Now we shall continue so far soooo......................................................bad.</p>
    <p> Hallo again. This website so far has been very fun creating, and I hope it is very fun looking at. May the adventures last!!!</p>
<p> I'm back, and better than ever... never mind that thing, it was just stuck in my head. oh, have you ever heard of... the illuminati? A triangle, basically for those who don't know, with one eye "I" haha. Here is a picture of a cartoon "imposter" version of the illuminati.</p>
   <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-yRj6xdG4I78/VgeiUvqBfuI/AAAAAAAACGE/gU2PO4WHapM/w599-h600/bill.gif"width= 95%</a>
   <p> Imposter...</p>
   <p> Whatever, Bill Cipher is that illuminati's name, and if you are Darren Chew, you will probably know about Gravity Falls.</p>
   <p> Hello Sierra, if you are out there. This is a pretty good website for you, as an artist. Thank me later, or don't actually... don't if you don't want to of course...:(</p>
   <a href="http://www.deviantart.com"> Click this to look into the world of creative artists...DEVIANTART</a>
   
   <p> Hi Kona, you will probably like this gif it is a victini.</p>
  <img src="http://45.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8jx7lL7Sx1r3ifxzo1_500.gif" width= 95%</a>
  <p> Well folks, let's continue. This took very long to make, considering it was a very short class. Write now, I'm just writing this all down in my notebook. I hope this is entertaining you.</p>
  <p> More about me... When I go to college, I want to study computer science, or architectural design. I want to become an inventor or architect. I also want to go to UCLA. Or USC. Or Berkeley. Usually I read books, and answer my emails. But before that, I also have to finish my homework and usually play badminton outside.</p>
  <p> If you really wanted to know, I went to El Marino, and I still go there everyday to pick up my siblings.</p>
  <p> It also is really confusing putting up this website and controlling it. But, it is really nice to have all of you looking at it, so thanks. I will try my best to upgrade it everyday!!!</p>
  <h1>  (: Friends :)</h1>

  <p> Here are some lyrics to some of my Fav. Songs</p> 
  <p>1. "Stand by You" by Rachel Platten: "Stand By You"
Hands, put your empty hands in mine
And scars, show me all the scars you hide
And hey, if your wings are broken
Please take mine so yours can open too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Oh, tears make kaleidoscopes in your eyes
And hurt, I know you're hurting, but so am I
And love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine 'til yours can open too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we're breaking down, we can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone, cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven, I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone, cause I'm gonna stand by you

Yeah, you're all I never knew I needed
And the heart, sometimes it's unclear why it's beating
And love, if your wings are broken
We can brave through those emotions too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you
Oh, truth, I guess truth is what you believe in
And faith, I think faith is having a reason
Nah, nah, nah, love, if your wings are broken
Borrow mine 'til yours can open too
Cause I'm gonna stand by you

Even if we're breaking down, we can find a way to break through
Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone, cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven, I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone, cause I'm gonna stand by you

I'll be your eyes 'til yours can shine
I'll be your arms, I'll be your steady satellite
And when you can't rise, well, I'll crawl with you on hands and knees
Cause I...
(I'm gonna stand by you)

Even if we're breaking down, we can find a way to break through (come on)
Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone, cause I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven, I'm gonna stand by you
Even if we can't find heaven, I'll walk through Hell with you
Love, you're not alone, cause I'm gonna stand by you
Love, you're not alone
Oh I'm gonna stand by you
(Even if we can't find heaven, heaven, heaven)
Yeah I'm gonna stand by you</p>
<p> "This is my Fight Song" by Rachel Platten
"Fight Song"

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
And it's been two years
I miss my home
But there's a fire burning in my bones
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe

And all those things I didn't say
Wrecking balls inside my brain
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?

This is my fight song
Take back my life song
Prove I'm alright song
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

A lot of fight left in me

Like a small boat
On the ocean
Sending big waves
Into motion
Like how a single word
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
But I can make an explosion

This is my fight song (Hey!)
Take back my life song (Hey!)
Prove I'm alright song (Hey!)
My power's turned on
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
I'll play my fight song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me

No I've still got a lot of fight left in me</p>

<p> "What Do you Mean?" by Justin Bieber
"What Do You Mean?"

What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end
Where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up then you're down and then between
Ohh I really want to know...

What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up then you're down and then between
Ohh I really wanna know...

What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

I want to know...
Oh
What do you mean?
Ohhh
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
(This is ours baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
(You're so confusing baby)
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(Be more straight forward)
Ohh
What do you mean?
(Give it back back back)
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
(Give it back back back)
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?</p>
<p> "Night Changes" by One Direction
"Night Changes"

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off

[Liam:]
Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She's heading for something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Louis:]
Chasing it tonight,
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop

[Niall:]
Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

[Harry:]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

[Harry (along all):]
We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you</p>
<p> "Amnesia" by 5sos (five seconds of summer)
"Amnesia"

[Calum:]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine

Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Luke:]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Calum:]
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around

It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?

'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Luke:]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

'Cause I'm not fine at all
No, I'm really not fine at all
Tell me this is just a dream
'Cause I'm really not fine at all</p>
<p> "Crossing Road" by LiSA
"Crossing Road"
Cloudy memories
Of the way it used to be
Search for answers I can't see
Looking back in time
All the images they tell me where I'm going
They guide me

Look to the skies it's a new day, every day
Feeling so confused
But I know your heart is true
Please trust in me

Flying so high up in the sky
I'm caught up in a dream
My fears they fade away
It's my reality
And now I know the reason why
I've got to make a change
Grow stronger every day
I need you here with me

I wanna always be with you
I"ll give you everything I have

I'm trapped in the dark but I'll never give in
I gotta break free, escape this endless nightmare
I won't stop

Searching in the dark
But I don't know where you are
Won't you guide me
I'm falling
Tremble at your touch
And I know I must return back to reality
It's calling

Close your eyes and just follow, you'll know
Pleasure and the pain
Come to haunt me once again
Just trust in me

Everything that we're dreaming of
You make my life complete
The smell of victory
It's in the air I breathe
I'll always be right by your side
I do it all for you
But nothing's as it seems
I'm floating in a dream

You gotta believe the power we feel
It comes from deep within our heart a promise
That we'll keep

Open my eyes I try to speak
I'm calling out your name
God bless the miracle that brought you here to me

Flying so high up in the sky
I'm caught up in a dream
My fears they fade away
It's my reality
And now I know the reason why
I've got to make a change
Grow stronger every day
I need you here with me

I'm trapped in the dark but I'll never give in
I gotta break free, escape this endless nightmare
I won't stop

I wanna always be with you,
I wanna hold you tight right now,
