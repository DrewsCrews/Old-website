<h3> Hello! On this website, you will be learning more about me and my interests.</h3>
<p>First of all, this is me.</p>
<p> No I'm not a blank space, I can explain my features. I have black spiked up hair, bronze brown eyes, I'm tall, and I enjoy reading.</p>
<p> Maybe, just maybe. That is not enough about me. Here is some other info about me. I might not give you so so so so so so personal info, but here is the basic idea. I like reading, as I said before. My favorite book is "where the Mountain meets the Moon". My favorite color is light blue, maybe like some of you.
    BTW I also enjoy playing Pokemon Shuffle, which is a puzzle game in which you have to match 3 or more of the same pokemon in order to damage the pokemon you are facing in each level.</p>
<h3> Here is an example of the game. </h3>
